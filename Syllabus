\section*{Course Description}

Principles of Microeconomics is an introductory undergraduate course that teaches the fundamentals of microeconomics. At FIU, this is one of the first courses that undergraduates take in economics. For some, it may be the only course they take in the subject, and it provides a solid foundation for economic analysis and thinking that can last throughout their education and subsequent professional careers. For other students, it may provide a foundation for many years of study in economics, business, or related fields.\\
\newline
This course begins with the economic foundations and refresher of algebra and use of graphs. Then it introduces the concept of trade-offs, opportunity costs, and comparative advantage, which are the basis to trade. Following, it introduces supply and demand and the basic forces that determine an equilibrium in a market economy as well as the forces that can disrupt economic efficiency. Next, it will introduce a framework for learning about consumer behavior and analyzing consumer decisions. The final section of the course then turns our attention to firms and their decisions about optimal production, and the impact of different market structures on firms' behavior. If time allows, we can cover some of the more advanced topics that can be analyzed using microeconomic theory. These include international trade, the operation of capital markets, and dynamics of labor markets.\\
\newline
By the end of the course, you will be able to understand introductory microeconomic theory, solve basic microeconomic problems, and use these techniques to think about things ranging from a number of policy questions relevant to the operation of the real economy to personal questions involving day-to-day decisions.

\section*{Course Goals}
After completing this course, students should have developed a range of skills enabling them to understand economic concepts and use those concepts to analyze specific questions. By the end of this course, students should be able to:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Understand consumer behavior.
    \item Understand firm behavior.
    \item Analyze different types of market structures (monopoly, oligopoly and a competitive market).
    \item Understand how to apply economic principles to a range of policy questions.
\end{itemize}
\medskip
Students should also have the skills needed to:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Use supply and demand diagrams to analyze the impact of overall changes in supply and demand on price and quantity.
    \item Solve a consumer's utility maximization problem mathematically and graphically; analyze the impact of changes in price and income on a consumer's decision via shifting income and substitution effects.
    \item Solve a firm's cost minimization problem mathematically and graphically.
    \item Analyze the behavior of firms in a perfectly competitive market in the short-run and the long-run.
    \item Calculate producer and consumer surplus.
    \item Analyze the behavior of firms in a monopoly or oligopoly, and calculate the resulting changes in producer or consumer surplus.
    \item Use economic tools to analyze economic policies.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Grading Policy}
I reserve the right to curve the grading scale contingent upon the overall class performance at the end of the semester. Any curve will only ever make it easier to obtain a certain letter grade. An `Incomplete' (`I') will be given only under exceptional circumstances. Such circumstances like a medical emergency, for example, requires proper documentation in order to receive an `I' grade and subsequently post-semester makeups to finish the course will ensue based on an agreement between the instructor and the student. Doing poorly in the course will not be considered a valid reason for an incomplete grade. Grade assessments and calculation are below:
\begin{itemize}
	\item \underline{\textbf{60\%}} of your grade will be determined by 4 non-cumulative exams: 25\% for the highest exam score, 20\% for the 2$^{nd}$ highest exam score, 15\% for the 3$^{rd}$ highest exam score), and the lowest exam score will be excluded from final grade.
	\item \underline{\textbf{30\%}} of your grade will be determined by MyLab homework. HW assignments will be assigned periodically throughout the semester and will be due at professor's discretion (usually one week from the date it is assigned). A \underline{maximum of two (2) attempts} per homework are allowed and only the highest score will count. Past due assignments will have 10 percentage points deducted from your score for each day it is late.
	\item \underline{\textbf{10\%}} of your grade will be determined by class attendance and participation (5\% each).
\end{itemize}
\medskip
\centering \textit{Final Grade = (Highest Exam Score * 0.25) + (2$^{nd}$ Highest Exam Score * 0.20) + (3$^{rd}$ Highest Exam Score * 0.15) + (Homework Average * 0.30) + (Class Attendance * 0.05) + (Class Participation * 0.05)}

\textbf{Please Note: Syllabus is tentative and subject to change at Instructor's discretion.}

% \subsection*{During Class}
% \footnotesize{I understand that the electronic recording of notes will be important for class and so computers will be allowed in class. Please refrain from using computers for anything but activities related to the class. Phones are prohibited as they are rarely useful for anything in the course. Eating and drinking are allowed in class but please refrain from it affecting the course. Try not to eat your lunch in class as the classes are typically active.}

% \subsection*{Attendance Policy}
% \footnotesize{For complete attendance and excused absence policies, please see http://policies.ncsu.edu/regulation/reg-02-20-03. Attendance is expected in all lecture and lab sections. Valid excuses for absence will be accepted before class. In extenuating circumstances, valid excuses with proof will be accepted after class. For every class missed the participation grade will be dropped 1 point.}

% \subsection*{Policies on Incomplete Grades and Late Assignments}
% \footnotesize{If an extended deadline is not authorized by the instructor or department, an unfinished incomplete grade will automatically change to an F after either (a) the end of the next regular semester in which the student is enrolled (not including summer sessions), or (b) the end of 12 months if the student is not enrolled, whichever is shorter. Incompletes that change to F will count as an attempted course on transcripts. The burden of fulfilling an incomplete grade is the responsibility of the student. The university policy on incomplete grades is located at http://policies.ncsu.edu/regulation/reg-02-50-3.}

% \footnotesize{Late assignments will be accepted for no penalty if a valid excuse is communicated to the instructor before the deadline. After the deadline, assignments will be accepted for a 50\% deduction to the score up to 2 days after the deadline. After this any assignments handed in will be given 0.}

% \subsection*{Academic Integrity and Honesty}
% \footnotesize{Students are required to comply with the university policy on academic integrity found in the Code of Student Conduct found at http://policies.ncsu.edu/policy/pol-11-35-01. Don't cheat. Don't be that guy. Yes, you. You know exactly what I'm talking about. See http://policies.ncsu.edu/policy/pol-11-35-01 for a detailed explanation of academic honesty.}

% \subsection*{Accommodations for Disabilities}
% \footnotesize{Reasonable accommodations will be made for students with verifiable disabilities. In order to take advantage of available accommodations, students must register with the Disability Services Office at Suite 2221, Student Health Center, Campus Box 7509, 919-515-7653.

% % Course Schedule %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

% \newpage
% \section*{Schedule and weekly learning goals}

% The schedule is tentative and subject to change. The learning goals below should be viewed as the key concepts you should grasp after each week, and also as a study guide before each exam, and at the end of the semester. Each exam will test on the material that was taught up until 1 week prior to the exam (i.e. vorticity will not be tested until exam 2). The applications in the second half of the semester tend to build on the concepts in the first half of the semester though, so it is still important to at least review those concepts throughout the semester.
